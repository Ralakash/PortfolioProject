            <p class="m-3">
              I was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan but have lived in multiple different states throughout my life. I have
              no children but am married and we have three dogs and three cats. In 207 completed my Bachelors degree in
              Psychology at Western Michigan University. I currently work in Child Welfare for the State of Michigan
              Department of Health and Human Services. I worked in the Foster Care field for three years and have
              recently changed to working in Children's Protective Services for the last year. Prior to working for
              MDHHS I worked for the United States Postal Service for two and a half years. I worked at PNC bank for six
              and a half years prior to the Post Office.<br /><br />
              In my free time I enjoy hiking and being outdoors. Traveling is one of my favorite things and almost all
              of my trips are road trips. Every Saturday I dungeon master for a game of Dungeons and Dragons, and have
              been doing that off and on for the last five years. I enjoy many board games in my free time as well as
              playing video games.
