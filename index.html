            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan but have lived in multiple different states throughout my life. I have no children but am married and we have three dogs and three cats. In 207 completed my Bachelors degree in Psychology at Western Michigan University. I currently work in Child Welfare for the State of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. I worked in the Foster Care field for three years and have recently changed to working in Children's Protective Services for the last year. Prior to working for MDHHS I worked for the United States Postal Service for two and a half years. I worked at PNC bank for six and a half years prior to the Post Office.<br><br>
                In my free time I enjoy hiking and being outdoors. Traveling is one of my favorite things and almost all of my trips are road trips. Every Saturday I dungeon master for a game of Dungeons and Dragons, and have been doing that off and on for the last five years. I enjoy many board games in my free time as well as playing video games.

                    This project was completed through CodeCademy and will be replaced as soon as I have the time and know how to make a project I can be proud of. <br><br> This was more of a proof of concept project.

                    This project was completed through the pre-work and is a study guide. <br><br> I appreciated what I learned in this project, it seems like an extream waste of time for me to formate a website as a study guide when a pen and paper take less time and are more accessable.
